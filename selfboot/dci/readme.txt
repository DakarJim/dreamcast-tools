DCi - Dreamcast CD image tool 1.1 for DOS by Jules
===================================================
Readme & FAQ in one.

New in 1.1
- no longer loads entire cd image into memory,
  so now you can patch cd images which size is
  bigger then your RAM size.
- removed "create new patched image" feature 
  so now you can only patch the image, not create new patched one.
  this was removed to due to the lack of time & the "not load
  cd image into memory" feature.

New in 1.0a
- Fixed serious fread() bug

Version 1.0 did not work, sorry about that.
The bug is fixed and it should work properly now.
