::-------------------------------------------------------


SCSI_ID 
it's the LUN for your writer in the form x,y,z
This should show you a list of CD-ROM and CD-Recorder units installed
in your system. Look for your CD-Recorder and find the SCSI Bus ID#.
It will be in format x,y,z
You can simply get CD-Recorder SCSI_ID by clicking the ScanBus.bat

* SCSI_ID must be setup before using the selfboot.bat, otherwise it'll not work *


WAV_SPEED
ISO_SPEED

it's the write speed
4 = write at 4x 
8 = write at 8x


CDRWIN_DIR
it's the Cdrwin.exe location

ie: C:\CDRWIN3\Cdrwin.exe
    C:\Program Files\CDRWIN\Cdrwin.exe
