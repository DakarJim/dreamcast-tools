Dreamcast Self-Boot Tutorial - (C) Echelon 2000!
------------------------------------------------

Introduction:
-------------

Since we find it a bit stupid to re-release nearly 200 DC titles over again,
and waste the bandwidth of FTP's and end-users, We thought we would release 
a tutorial & toolset with which you can convert all of your old Utopia loader
games to the newer self-boot format. 

Limitations:
------------

Self-Boot and Multisession code requires 3 Minutes of Overhead on the CD
you are burning. So, if you are burning to an 80 Minute CD, Your data
must be approximately 77 Minutes, If you are burning to a 74 Minute CD,
Your data must be approximately 71 Minutes. If the data is over this
size, Your burn will fail. Many end-users claimed they could easily rip 
games and downsize them, but didn't know to read in GD-ROMs. So here is
your chance to prove your theories, Go ahead and rip down the games you
are trying to burn by 3 Minutes if they are Full CDs.

Tutorial for games without CDDA:
--------------------------------

1) Make a directory on your hard-disk called "selfboot"

2) UnZIP this whole file (E-SELFBT.ZIP) to the directory.

3) Download Win32 Binaries for CDRECORD & MKISOFS from:

   ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/alpha/win32/cdrtools-1.9a03-win32-bin.zip

4) Unzip the file (cdrtools-1.9a03-win32-bin.zip) to the directory you made
   on your hard disk earlier called "selfboot".

5) Insert the Utopia Boot-CD version of the game into your CD-ROM drive,
   Copy over the IP.BIN and 1ST_READ.BIN from the CD over to the "selfboot"
   directory on your hard disk.

   (Note 1: IP.BIN cannot be found on Accession releases, therefore Accession
    releases cannot be made self-boot from this method.)

   (Note 2: 1ST_READ.BIN might not be the exact name of the boot filename, If
    you want to check what the boot filename really is on some games, open up
    IP.BIN in a hex or text editor. Look on the top, It should say something
    similar to: "V.001XXXXXXXX BLAH.BIN". If it says this, That means that
    BLAH.BIN is the boot-filename, and this is the file that you should copy
    over. If the game is using WinCE this filename will be 0WINCEOS.BIN.
    This file will be referred to as BOOT.BIN from here-on. Please make sure
    you don't think that BOOT.BIN is an actual file, It is just a alias as
    this file can be named many things.)

6) OK, So now in your "selfboot" directory, you should have this tutorial
   unzipped, cdrecord and all related cdrecord tools, and you should also
   have copied over the IP.BIN and BOOT.BIN from the game that you
   are working on.

7) Make a subdirectory called "data" inside your "selfboot" directory
   and copy ALL game data files from the Utopia-BootCD game into this
   directory. Also, delete the file IP.BIN from the "data" directory if
   you already have it in the root of your "selfboot" tree. Also delete
   the BOOT.BIN (generally 1ST_READ.BIN) from your data tree if
   you have already put this file in the root of your "selfboot" tree.

   (Note: All files that you copy from a CD will have Read-Only attributes,
    You must take these off before continuing.)

8) Now, you have 2 ways of achieving the same thing for this step, I will
   go over both ways and you can choose whichever you want. To start off
   for both methods, insert a blank disk into your CD-Recorder.

   1) CDRWIN Method:
      
      a) Fire up CDRWIN.
         Goto the first icon on the top left: "Record Disc"
      b) Click the icon in the top right corner: "Load tracks"
      c) Click add, then choose the file AUDIO.RAW in your "selfboot"
         dir. This file was included in the E-SELFBT.ZIP archive.
      d) Click the tab "Open New Session" near the bottom.
      e) Burn this CD.

   2) CDRECORD Method:
 
      a) If your CD-Recorder cannot use the "Open New Session" option
         in CDRWIN, You have one more way to do it, that may or may not
         work.
      b) In the "selfboot" directory you should have the cdrecord toolset
         unzipped. You should see files such as cdrecord.exe, mkisofs.exe,
         and cygwin1.dll.
      c) Run the following command from a DOS Prompt:
         cdrecord -scanbus
      d) This should show you a list of CD-ROM and CD-Recorder units installed
         in your system. Look for your CD-Recorder and find the SCSI Bus ID#.
         It will be in format x,x,x. It will also be referred to as x,x,x for
         the rest of this tutorial.
      e) In your "selfboot" directory, run the following command to record
         the 1st session of the disk:
         
         cdrecord -dev=x,x,x -multi -audio audio.raw
         
         You can optionally include "speed=x" after -audio, Where x is the
         maximum speed that your CD-Recorder can record at.

9) OK, Now that you have the first session burned, it's time to move onto
   the second. This is the crucial part so make sure you pay attention and
   follow things closely. You should already have all game data files in the
   subdirectory "data", except for BOOT.BIN and IP.BIN.

10) Read over the CDRECORD burn instructions. Find out the SCSI Bus ID# of
    your CD-Recorder If you have not done so already. Run the following 
    command:
   
    cdrecord -dev=x,x,x -msinfo

    It will spit out a number in the form x,y. Normal values are 0,11700 or
    0,11702 for a CD which only has AUDIO.RAW burned on the 1st session.

11) Run a DOS Prompt and goto your "selfboot" directory, You should have
    an executable there called "BINHACK.EXE". In addition you should have
    the BOOT.BIN (generally called 1ST_READ.BIN) and IP.BIN in this 
    directory.

    Run the program BINHACK.EXE. When it prompts you for the Binary
    file to modify, Pick the BOOT.BIN. If it detects that the BOOT.BIN
    is a Windows CE Exectuable (0WINCEOS.BIN), It will not modify the
    0WINCEOS.BIN. If it detects that this Executable is a normal 
    Katana Executable, It will ask you for the the -msinfo number that 
    CDRECORD gave you in the last step. It will then modify the 
    BOOT.BIN according to the number that cdrecord -msinfo gave you. 
    Next, It will ask you for the filename of the Bootsector. Here,
    you should input IP.BIN. It will hack the IP.BIN for self-boot
    purposes.

     (Side Note: Only input the 2nd Number that MSINFO gave you,
     Ex. If it gave you: 0,163012, Input 163012 when BINHACK prompts
     you for the MSINFO number.)

12) Once the changes are made with BINHACK.EXE to the BOOT.BIN file, Copy
    the BOOT.BIN over to the "data" directory's root. Please make sure
    that you did not rename the file to actually be called BOOT.BIN.
    It should still be called the original filename that you found out
    from Step 5. 


13) Now, you should have in your "data" directory, All game data files,
    including BOOT.BIN, But it should not have IP.BIN. If you want to
    dummy this CD, You must make a dummy now. You must make a normal
    file dummy. Name this dummy "000DUMMY.DAT" and place it into the
    "data" directory. Please note the overhead limitations of 
    Multi-Session & Self-Booting that were mentioned at the beginning 
    of the tutorial, and size your dummy accordingly. Your next step 
    is to run MKISOFS and make a ISO out of these files. Run the 
    following command while you are in your "selfboot" root directory: 

    mkisofs -C x,y -V ECHELON -l -o data.iso data

    "x,y" should be the numbers outputted to you from cdrecord -msinfo 
    earlier.

14) Run "IPINS.EXE" from the "selfboot" directory, In a DOS Prompt.
    It will prompt you for the Bootsector filename, Choose IP.BIN.
    It will then prompt you for the ISO filename, Choose the file
    "data.iso" which you just generated in the last step. It will
    patch IP.BIN as the bootsector on data.iso.

15) You should now have a fairly large sized data.iso file sitting in
    your "selfboot" directory tree now. It is time to burn this file.
    You should still have the disk you burned the audio session to
    earlier inserted in your CD-Recorder. You can do this with
    either CDRWIN or CDRECORD, Just as the Audio Session Burning.

    1) CDRWIN Method
       
       a) Fire up CDRWIN.
       b) Click the 2nd Icon from the Top Left: "File Backup and Tools".
       c) For Backup Tool/Operation: Select "Record an ISO9660 Image File".
       d) For Image Filename, Choose data.iso in your "selfboot" directory.
       e) Under Recording Options, Select your CD-Recorder. Check the
          following options accordingly:
   
          Disc Type: CDROM-XA
          Track Mode: MODE2
          SPEED: Whatever You Want
          Finalize/Close Session: Yes
          Write Postgap: Yes 
          Open New Session: No
          Test Mode: No
          Verify Recorded Image: No

       f) Click the start button and you are burning.

    2) CDRECORD Method
  
      a) In the "selfboot" directory you should have the cdrecord toolset
         unzipped. You should see files such as cdrecord.exe, mkisofs.exe,
         and cygwin1.dll.
      b) Run the following command from a DOS Prompt:
         cdrecord -scanbus
      c) This should show you a list of CD-ROM and CD-Recorder units installed
         in your system. Look for your CD-Recorder and find the SCSI Bus ID#.
         It will be in format x,x,x.
      d) In your "selfboot" directory, run the following command to record
         the 2nd session of the disk:
         
         cdrecord -dev=x,x,x -xa1 data.iso
         
         You can optionally include "speed=x" after -audio, Where x is the
         maximum speed that your CD-Recorder can record at.

16) You are done! Eject the disk and try it in your Dreamcast.

Tutorial for games with CDDA:
-----------------------------

1) Make a directory on your hard-disk called "selfboot"

2) UnZIP this whole file (E-SELFBT.ZIP) to the directory.

3) Download Win32 Binaries for CDRECORD & MKISOFS from:

   ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/alpha/win32/cdrtools-1.9a03-win32-bin.zip

4) Unzip the file (cdrtools-1.9a03-win32-bin.zip) to the directory you made
   on your hard disk earlier called "selfboot".

5) Insert the Utopia Boot-CD version of the game into your CD-ROM drive,
   Copy over the IP.BIN and 1ST_READ.BIN from the CD over to the "selfboot"
   directory on your hard disk.

   (Note 1: IP.BIN cannot be found on Accession releases, therefore Accession
    releases cannot be made self-boot from this method.)

   (Note 2: 1ST_READ.BIN might not be the exact name of the boot filename, If
    you want to check what the boot filename really is on some games, open up
    IP.BIN in a hex or text editor. Look on the top, It should say something
    similar to: "V.001XXXXXXXX BLAH.BIN". If it says this, That means that
    BLAH.BIN is the boot-filename, and this is the file that you should copy
    over. If the game is using WinCE this filename will be 0WINCEOS.BIN.
    This file will be referred to as BOOT.BIN from here-on.

6) OK, So now in your "selfboot" directory, you should have this tutorial
   unzipped, cdrecord and all related cdrecord tools, and you should also
   have copied over the IP.BIN and BOOT.BIN from the game that you
   are working on.

7) Make a subdirectory called "data" inside your "selfboot" directory
   and copy ALL game data files from the Utopia-BootCD game into this
   directory. Also, delete the file IP.BIN from the "data" directory if
   you already have it in the root of your "selfboot" tree. Also delete
   the BOOTFILENAME.BIN (generally 1ST_READ.BIN) from your data tree if
   you have already put this file in the root of your "selfboot" tree.

   (Note: All files that you copy from a CD will have Read-Only attributes,
    You must take these off before continuing.)

8) Make a subdirectory called "cdda" inside your "selfboot" directory
   tree. Fire up CDRWIN and click the Middle Icon on the top row 
   called "Extract Disc/Tracks/Sectors". Choose your CD Reader in which
   the original Utopia Boot-CD Game is inserted. Choose the Select Tracks
   option at the top. As you will see in the Track Selection box at
   the left, Audio tracks are represented by Red Circles. Click on Tracks
   2 - X, where X is the last CDDA track. As you click on them they should
   be outlined in black. For image filename input: "C:\selfboot\cdda\track",
   Where C:\selfboot\cdda is the "cdda" directory inside your "selfboot"
   tree.

9) The above step should have read in CDDA tracks 2 -> End and placed them
   as WAV files named trackxx.wav inside your "cdda" directory. They should
   start with track02.wav and go up to trackxx.wav where xx is the last 
   CDDA track on the CD. 

10) Open up a DOS Prompt and switch to your "cdda" directory. Type in the
    following command:

    copy track03.wav track01.wav

    After doing this, You should have generated Tracks 1 - 3, You should
    now have 3 4-second dummy tracks as Tracks 1 - 3, and have real CDDA
    from 4 -> End.

11) Now, you have 2 ways of achieving the same thing for this step, I will
    go over both ways and you can choose whichever you want. To start off
    for both methods, insert a blank disk into your CD-Recorder.

    1) CDRWIN Method:
      
       a) Fire up CDRWIN.
          Goto the first icon on the top left: "Record Disc"
       b) Click the icon in the top right corner: "Load tracks"
       c) Click add, then choose ALL trackxx.wav files in your "cdda"
          directory. Arrange them in order so they go from track01.wav
          to the end. Click OK to add them to your disc layout.
       d) Click the tab "Open New Session" near the bottom.
       e) Burn this CD.

   2) CDRECORD Method:
 
      a) If your CD-Recorder cannot use the "Open New Session" option
         in CDRWIN, You have one more way to do it, that may or may not
         work.
      b) In the "selfboot" directory you should have the cdrecord toolset
         unzipped. You should see files such as cdrecord.exe, mkisofs.exe,
         and cygwin1.dll.
      c) Run the following command from a DOS Prompt:
         cdrecord -scanbus
      d) This should show you a list of CD-ROM and CD-Recorder units installed
         in your system. Look for your CD-Recorder and find the SCSI Bus ID#.
         It will be in format x,x,x. It will also be referred to as x,x,x for
         the rest of this tutorial.
      e) In your "selfboot" directory, run the following command to record
         the 1st session of the disk:
         
         cdrecord -dev=x,x,x -multi -audio \cdda\track01.wav \cdda\track02.wav etc.

         Continue going with your track list until you have input all tracks
         in order. If this whole command does not fit into your DOS Prompt,
         make a batch file with this long command and run the batch file.
         
         You can optionally include "speed=x" after -audio, Where x is the
         maximum speed that your CD-Recorder can record at.

12) OK, Now that you have the first session (CDDA) burned, it's time to move onto
   the second. This is the crucial part so make sure you pay attention and
   follow things closely. You should already have all game data files in the
   subdirectory "data", besides the BOOT.BIN and IP.BIN.

13) Read over the CDRECORD burn instructions. Find out the SCSI Bus ID# of
    your CD-Recorder If you have not done so already. Run the following 
    command:
   
    cdrecord -dev=x,x,x -msinfo

    It will spit out a number in the form x,y. Values differ enormously
    for games that have different amounts of CDDA burned to the first
    session. Make sure you get the correct value.

14) Run a DOS Prompt and goto your "selfboot" directory, You should have
    an executable there called "BINHACK.EXE". In addition you should have
    the BOOT.BIN (generally called 1ST_READ.BIN) and IP.BIN in this 
    directory.

    Run the program BINHACK.EXE. When it prompts you for the Binary
    file to modify, Pick the BOOT.BIN. If it detects that the BOOT.BIN
    is a Windows CE Exectuable (0WINCEOS.BIN), It will not modify the
    0WINCEOS.BIN. If it detects that this Executable is a normal 
    Katana Executable, It will ask you for the the -msinfo number that 
    CDRECORD gave you in the last step. It will then modify the 
    BOOT.BIN according to the number that cdrecord -msinfo gave you. 
    Next, It will ask you for the filename of the Bootsector. Here,
    you should input IP.BIN. It will hack the IP.BIN for self-boot
    purposes.

     (Side Note: Only input the 2nd Number that MSINFO gave you,
     Ex. If it gave you: 0,163012, Input 163012 when BINHACK prompts
     you for the MSINFO number.)

15) Once the changes are made with BINHACK.EXE to the BOOT.BIN file, Copy
    the BOOT.BIN over to the "data" directory's root. Please make sure
    that you did not rename the file to actually be called BOOT.BIN.
    It should still be called the original filename that you found out
    from Step 5. 

16) Now, you should have in your "data" directory, All game data files,
    including BOOT.BIN, But it should not have IP.BIN. If you want to
    dummy this CD, You must make a dummy now. You must make a normal
    file dummy. Name this dummy "000DUMMY.DAT" and place it into the
    "data" directory. Please note the overhead limitations of 
    Multi-Session & Self-Booting that were mentioned at the beginning 
    of the tutorial, and size your dummy accordingly. Your next step 
    is to run MKISOFS and make a ISO out of these files. Run the 
    following command while you are in your "selfboot" root directory: 

    mkisofs -C x,y -V ECHELON -l -o data.iso data

    "x,y" should be the numbers outputted to you from cdrecord -msinfo 
    earlier.

17) Run "IPINS.EXE" from the "selfboot" directory, In a DOS Prompt.
    It will prompt you for the Bootsector filename, Choose IP.BIN.
    It will then prompt you for the ISO filename, Choose the file
    "data.iso" which you just generated in the last step. It will
    patch IP.BIN as the bootsector on data.iso.

18) You should now have a fairly large sized data.iso file sitting in
    your "selfboot" directory tree now. It is time to burn this file.
    You should still have the disk you burned the audio session to
    earlier inserted in your CD-Recorder. You can do this with
    either CDRWIN or CDRECORD, Just as the Audio Session Burning.

    1) CDRWIN Method
       
       a) Fire up CDRWIN.
       b) Click the 2nd Icon from the Top Left: "File Backup and Tools".
       c) For Backup Tool/Operation: Select "Record an ISO9660 Image File".
       d) For Image Filename, Choose data.iso in your "selfboot" directory.
       e) Under Recording Options, Select your CD-Recorder. Check the
          following options accordingly:
   
          Disc Type: CDROM-XA
          Track Mode: MODE2
          SPEED: Whatever You Want
          Finalize/Close Session: Yes
          Write Postgap: Yes 
          Open New Session: No
          Test Mode: No
          Verify Recorded Image: No

       f) Click the start button and you are burning.

    2) CDRECORD Method
  
      a) In the "selfboot" directory you should have the cdrecord toolset
         unzipped. You should see files such as cdrecord.exe, mkisofs.exe,
         and cygwin1.dll.
      b) Run the following command from a DOS Prompt:
         cdrecord -scanbus
      c) This should show you a list of CD-ROM and CD-Recorder units installed
         in your system. Look for your CD-Recorder and find the SCSI Bus ID#.
         It will be in format x,x,x.
      d) In your "selfboot" directory, run the following command to record
         the 2nd session of the disk:
         
         cdrecord -dev=x,x,x -xa1 data.iso
         
         You can optionally include "speed=x" after -audio, Where x is the
         maximum speed that your CD-Recorder can record at.

19) You are done! Eject the disk and try it in your Dreamcast.
