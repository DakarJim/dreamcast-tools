 This is the second installment of the Dreamcast development environment ISO. It
 contains an installer with step-by-step instuctions on how to install the
 environment. You do not need to downloading any extra files.
 
 If you find any problems with the installer itself such as, grammar, spelling, not 
 installing, erorrs, being a PITA, etc. - send me an e-mail immediately and I'll 
 try to get it figured out.
 
 Also, please do NOT e-mail me your programming questions. I am NOT a programmer.
 Doing so will result in an ignored e-mail. Instead, direct your questions here:
