 * What's this *
 It's a CD with the complete Dreamcast development, without 
 needing to download any extra files. Minimal CYWGIN install
 to get the ISO down to a good size. This doesn't effect the DC
 environment at all.
 
 NOTE: When you're installing CYGWIN you may notice it looks
       as if it has froze. If you let it be, you will notice 
       that it isn't.

 wouldn't be using this ISO.
 
 Quzar for the help on minimizing CYGWIN to cut the original
 size in half.
