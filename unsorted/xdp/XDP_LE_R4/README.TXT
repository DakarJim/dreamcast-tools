   XDP DREAMS (Limited Edition)


  +-- [[[ 08-08-08 ]]] -----------------------------------------------+
  +===================================================================+
  |                                                                   |
  | This is the fourth & probably final release of XDP.  (XDP R-4)    |
  | It has been more than 2 years since I've had time to work on it.  |
  | I had intended to make more graphical changes and do a complete   |
  | interface update, but I'm on a new computer and can't seem to     |
  | find a lot of my old files and templates.  Basicly, this is the   |
  | release I was wanting to do in '06, but was unable to back then   |
  | because of failing PC hardware.  I've had ideas for a new inter-  |
  | face since '06, but may never get the time to implement them.     |
  | All bugs having to do with me have been worked out, (meaning      |
  | the VMU loading bug), so unless a programmer wishes to add        |
  | features to the code, I see no reason to pursue further develop-  |
  | ment of the browser.  Any future updates will likely be "skin-    |
  | packs" rather than full blown releases, but we'll see.  If there  |
  | remains enough interest, I may make enough changes to the inter-  |
  | face to merit another release.  Time will tell.  All content      |
  | below is from '06, as is the rest of this browser.                |
  |                                                                   |

  | There are more things updated than I can think of, but some of    |
  | the changes include:                                              |

  | * Improved Tools section with fixed and added tools.              |
  | * Now able to return to main launch menu from browser.            |
  | * Includes Flash internet settings adjuster for 1st ISP.          |
  | * VMU saves library from former Dreamserv & more added.           |
  | * Default XDP ICON_VMS changed (no more funky flower).            |
  | * VMS Utility program added (among others).                       |

  |                                                                   |
  | I hope you enjoy using this disc.                                 |

  |                                                                   |
  | If you have questions, there is a comprehensive help section      |
  | that I took a lot of time to put together, so please check it     |
  | out.  You can find it by simply clicking 'HELP' from the start    |
  | page of XDP.  The Help Manual has also been made available at     |
  | the Welcome Page on your PC.  Please note that Javascript         |
  | should be enabled in your browser to view the content properly.   |
  |                                                                   |
  | If the Welcome Page does not automatically open when you put this |
  | disc in your PC, you can access it by any of these methods:       |
  |                                                                   |
  |  * Open "My Computer" and doulbe-click on your CD-ROM drive.      |
  | or                                                                |
  |  * Execute/Run "XDP.EXE" from the CD, (don't worry, it will not   |
  |    install any software on your PC).                              |
  | or                                                                |
  |  * Open the CD in Windows Explorer, find and open "INDEX.HTML"    |
  |    from the root of the CD.                                       |
  |                                                                   |
  | If AFTER reading the help section, you still have questions,      |
  | feel free to ask at either of these sites:                        |

  | Note: Unfortunately, ch@b went offline Feb 16, 2006, but I've     |
  | left the following content for nostalgia and history purposes.    |
  |                                                                   |
  +-- [[[ HISTORICAL ONLY ]]] ----------------------------------------+
  |                                                                   |
  | If you would like to attempt creating an ISAO account, you        |
  | may do so using the guide on this disc.  However, there is        |
  | no gaurantee that your account will not be terminated.            |
  | ISAO is very finicky about how accounts are created and they      |
  | seem to check very closely for accuracy.                          |
  |                                                                   |
  | The ISAO guide is available from the Welcome Page on your PC      |
  | as well as in the Help Manual within XDP on your Dreamcast.       |
  |                                                                   |
  | You will also find DreamPassport for PC and Mac on this disc.     |
  | Just look in the DPFORPC folder for the PC version, or the root   |
  | of this disc for the lite version and Mac version.                |
  |                                                                   |

  |                                                                   |
  | Be sure to check out the credits!  You can view them on your PC   |
  | by clicking on "(c)Excalibur007 2002-2008" at the bottom of the   |
  | Welcome Page, or by clicking the Credits link in the Help Manual. |
  |                                                                   |
  | To view the credits within XDP on your Dreamcast, open the Help   |
  | section from the top bar and click on the Credits link.           |
  |                                                                   |

  +-- [[[ MAKING YOUR OWN CUSTOM BROWSER ]]] -------------------------+
  +===================================================================+
  |                                                                   |
  | It has been my intention to translate the browser and make        |
  | it easier for other users to figure out.  I would LOVE to         |
  | see more people creating custom browsers.  I know there are       |
  | people out there with much better skills than I have, and I       |
  | would love to see greater works accomplished than this.           |
  | However, you should note that if you plan to use these files,     |
  | you MUST use XDP core files with XDP.  In other words, start      |
  | from the files on this disc and add your own content.  XDP        |
  | is NOT compatible with core files of other Dream Passport         |
  | browsers.                                                         |
  | The core files that must be used with XDP are:                    |
  |  * NTP.DPS                                                        |
  |  * PM.DPS                                                         |
  |  * VMS.DPS                                                        |
  |  * XDP.DPS                                                        |
  |  * XDP.INI                                                        |
  | You can feel free to edit the above files, (and you will          |
  | need to if you want to change any colors), but there has          |
  | been so much changed they will not work with a standard           |
  | Dream Passport 1st_read.bin.                                      |
  | Files such as chat.dps, softkey.dps and a few others ARE          |
  | interchangable with other Dream Passport browsers, but use        |
  | them at your own discretion.                                      |
  | PVR files are the graphical interface files and are fully         |
  | customizable.  Find a PVR plugin for Photoshop to download        |
  | from the internet and use the existing PVRs as a guide.           |
  |                                                                   |
  | Of course, as any honest person would do, you must give the       |
  | proper credit if using files I've made or otherwise worked on.    |
  |                                                                   |
  | If you would like more details about this, you can visit          |
  | our IRC chat room at:                                             |
