[22:38] [10:38pm] <HyperG>  Majin hows DBZ game ?
[22:38] [10:38pm] <Pr0n_Czar_Mike>  he said there are no graphical enhancements, yet he says the games are running in 640x480, thats enhancement
[22:38] [10:38pm] <renob>  Bling: The odds of that being true are very low. This would be the first emulator to my knowledge, that was released in such a manner
[22:39] [10:39pm] <ragnarok2040>  where at?
[22:39] [10:39pm] <ILuvJen>  i beleived him up until the BIOS Q. who ever asked that, thank you for setting me straight
[22:39] [10:39pm] <NiGHTSFTP>  i have a good feeling bout this one
[22:39] [10:39pm] <Exophase>  Roof; That's not the POINT
[22:39] [10:39pm] <HyperG>  Majin release tomorow dude!!!!!1
[22:39] [10:39pm] <Revenant>  I would wonder why a person, who ostensibly holds a chat session to 'prove' his cause, would refuse to answer the only sorts of questions that could actually do that.

[22:39] [10:39pm] <Bling>  renob exactly
[22:39] [10:39pm] <Exophase>  The point is he said they're run in 640x480 no matter what, while the screenshots are NOT AT 640x480, as far as I can tell.

[22:39] [10:39pm] <Exophase>  What do you mean ILuvJen, several N64 games have 640x480 modes.
[22:39] [10:39pm] <Brymaster>  anyone who believes this emu is real after this interview = lamer
[22:39] [10:39pm] <NiGHTSFTP>  (i also had a gut feelin supercast was fake, and that ended up true. I thought they might just make a new GUI, but they didnt even do that :D)
[22:39] [10:39pm] <Tavis>  hahahaha, http://go.to/conjunction-junction
